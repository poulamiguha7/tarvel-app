# Travel Application

This Travel Application is built as part of Udacity FEND Capstone Project

## Project Objective

This project aims to give you the opportunity to put all of the skills I have learned into one project to build my own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it is very JavaScript-heavy, but it still needs clean and appealing HTML/CSS. I've targeted the DOM, worked with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this was all done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers. 

In addition, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used as a testing framework. 

## Advanced Extra Feature Added
Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
